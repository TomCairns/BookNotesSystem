# BookNotesSystem
A google sheets/google forms for tracking books read and making notes on them

The system consists of a google spreadsheet, with code to build 3 separate forms, one for each book started, one to make notes on a
book, and one to record when you've finished it. The idea behind using google sheets is a) I like spreadsheets and b) this gives a 
more flexibility to anyone else using them.
